review/text: Based on the reviews, it's clear that this is a fun game IF you have someone who knows how to play it who can teach it to you. In our case we had 4 people (2 of them with PhDs) trying to figure out the directions for 45 mins with no luck. Then we resorted to youtube for help, and all of the instructional videos just explained it as "It's simple! Game play is similar to <game I've never heard of> and you collect points just like in <another game of never heard of> and that's all there is to it!" Okay, that's not helpful to me. What a waste of an hour with good friends.

review/text: I bought this game based on the description and reviews which gave the impression that this game is simple, easy to learn, and quick to play. We just spent an hour trying to figure out how to START the game and decided to give up. The directions are terrible. Maybe it would be a fun game if it could be explained better (a lot better).

review/text: Nobody I've played with has really enjoyed this game all that much. There are simply too many options for scoring points, too much randomness, and not enough free will in what you get or play for it to be easy to figure out what you're doing or what your friends are planning. I feel that, while the game itself is not that complex rules-wise, there's a lot of complexity in scoring without a lot of depth of play or fun involved.

review/text: Too complicated. Hard to engage the kids because it took too long to explain it. Definitely not for anyone under 13. Even my 12 year old decided it was too much and left the game. Unfortunately that's who we bought it for.

review/text: Quite a few reviews compare this game with Dominion and Race for the Galaxy, but, as a regular player of both, 7 Wonders doesn't play at all like the two. I suppose that, since 7 Wonders has cards which you pick, that makes 7 Wonders similar to both Race and Dominion. Which, in my opinion, it does not. Eurogamers should like 7 Wonders, but, as an erstwhile non-drafting CCG player, I found this game as generic as any other Eurogame (cards and boards have good art, though). The drafting pretty much tweaks the usual tired "multiple paths to victory" Eurogame mechanic. Drafting *does* require you deny cards the player you will pass card on to, but I'm pretty "meh" on this mechanic. As with other "multiple paths to victory" Eurogames, you'll need to "become familiar with" (aka. memorize) the cards -- not to mention scoring system -- a Eurogame tendency which pretty much negates the selling point of the simplicity of the game mechanics. If you're looking for a Eurogame with another novel mechanic (by Eurostandards), I guess this is it. But if 7 Wonders is comparable to Dominion, both are just like Risk.

review/text: Let me start by admitting that I do enjoy the game and my 9 y.o. daughter asks to play it frequently. I also like the fact that it is a thinking and strategy game that can be played to completion in less than 30 minutes. However, this is our first "card draft" game, meaning that there is no shared 'game board' or associated action. So, if you are looking for a board game with game pieces and competition for real estate or board position, or something similar to Settlers of Catan, then this is a different experience. I do compliment this game for it's thoughtful complexity, so that each time is different, but the method of calculating your final score can be confusing -- on the plus side, that makes it difficult for any player to be assured of advantage during play. The ultimate object of the game is to amass "victory points", which are earned in multiple ways and tallied after play completes. However, the game is named "7 Wonders" with a nod to the 7 wonders of the ancient world, which you "build" through game play. I just wish that there were some physical representation of 'building' a structure, instead of the mere placement of (not so) strategically selected cards.

review/text: It is a good game. I have really enjoyed this game. I have played with gamers and non board gamers alike. Each time I play it the game changes slightly to keep my interest. I have really enjoyed playing this game. The instructions are a bit intimidating but once you start playing it is actually fairly easy to play. There are a lot of meanings in the card which is somewhat confusing the first time you play it. I think the hardest part is know who to calculate the score. Mainly on the green cards. I have to read the instructions every time playing the game how to calculate that score. I still wonder if I'm doing it right.

review/text: It took us forever to figure out this game. I think mainly it's because of the terrible translation of the instructions from German to English. All of the Rio Grande games seem to have this problem. However, this game, once you figure it out, is pretty good. We play with 2 people so it's a little harder, but still a good game of strategy.

review/text: Positives: Great Strategy, very few luck factors, plays for both large parties and down to 2. AND RUN TIME IS only 30 MINUTES! For hard core game players, a 2 hour game is doable. But for the average sit down and enjoy a semi-competitive game, a 2 hour game is a killer. It's rare that you will find a quality strategic game with multiple winning variants that you can finish in under an hour, much less 30 minutes. It's almost too quick. Almost. I would certainly buy an expansion pack if they had one... in fact that is probably the only downside to the game right now... I want some more of IT! Cons: No expansion pack is available for round 4. ...Just in case we have some board gaming friends that want a little more of a beating. =) I would rate this in my top 10 list of games for sure. And for games under an hour, this one takes 1st place. But don't mind me, I am just a pest control guy. -Thomas

review/text: A worthy addition to our "Settlers of Catan" gaming group. Shorter games with more reliance on strategy and less dependence on change. However, and it's a big however; We miss the opportunity to socialize and get an overall, unfolding view of the game as it progresses, as is possible in "Settlers". It's a heads-down, make-your-decision, pass-them-on and don't-distract-me,-I'm-plotting game that lacks the social pleasures of the more leisurely pace of "Settlers of Catan".

review/text: Great game, good for new players and true gamers. It's not too long to play, very replayable, and fun. I played it a bunch before I broke down and bought my own copy, and am glad I did because I've been able to show it to a bunch of new players who wouldn't have been exposed to it otherwise.

review/text: The game is a ton of fun in the beginning, it's nice that you get to switch up the 'board' every game so it's different each time. But once you play it a few time's it becomes pretty obvious how to win.

review/text: Played this with a bunch of folks who are really into Race for the Galaxy and Dominion, among many other board games. Scales well up to 7 people. And it's not hard to teach. Those who aren't as much into gaming and strategy can still enjoy themselves while those who are very into strategy are also challenged. Agree with one review that mentions sleeves might be nice since the cards put into play depends on how many players are in the game which may mean some cards get a lot more wear. Cards don't seem to be of a "standard" size, but Mayday games is making a sleeve that has come out in Dec 2010.

review/text: I'm very satisfied with this game so far. I've played probably 20 times so far, and i cant get enough. I have played with 2,3,4,5 and 6 players and the game ran beautifully with each set of players. I even played this game with my parents (mid 50s) and they were able to grasp the main concepts. The 2-player variant is surprisingly seamless, it uses a phantom 3rd player *groan* and usually i hate having that but since the third player has so much effect on each player's strategy, it works out very well. I'm continuously surprised at how well balanced the game is, with most scores having a <10 point spread, unless something crazy happens. So far, everyone I've played with just loves it! Get this game!

review/text: I play many different tabletop boardgames, and this one is easily my favorite! It combines the resource management characteristics of Catan with the deck builder qualities of Dominion and is infused with this lovely theme of the 7 Wonders of the ancient world. The leaders expansion is fun, too!

review/text: Originally purchased this because we played it at on a family trip. At the time it wasn't very popular among the rest of the family, because rules weren't explained well, and a lot of frustration was involved. Now that we have played it several times though, I have to say it is a great game! Would definitely recommend getting the iOS app to help with scoring (just makes things so much easier). The rules do take some getting used to (especially for those who are more experienced at playing "traditional" board games), but once you get the hang of them, the game is immensely fun!

review/text: The instructions are difficult to follow. It's much easier to play when you play with a couple of people who have played before. Once you play a round, it's very easy to understand, but for someone who has never played before, the concepts are difficult to grasp from just the instructions.  Once you get familiar with the gameplay, this game is an ABSOLUTE BLAST!

review/text: This game went very slowly the first time through. Five non-gamers studying the rule-book spent a lot of time saying "I don't get it." Once we all did untangle the rules and intricasies of the game, the second and third games were quick and enjoyable. The more we play, the more we uncover strategies and complexities that will make it worth replaying many times. We got multiple games this Christmas, and this was the most difficult to play the first time, but it turned out to be the favorite, likely to be replayed many times. It was definitely worth muddling that initial first play-through. In retrospect, we should have watched a youtube video of the game first. Even better, if you can play this with at least one person who is already familiar with the game, that will save you a lot of frustration.

review/text: This is one of my gaming group's favorite games. We appreciate it because it plays up to 7 Players unlike most of our other games. The rules are simple and most disputes are covered in the rule book. We have played through over 80 rounds of this game. We have boiled down the rules to "pick a card, play a card" which is helpful for first time players. The first few play throughs are a little lengthy as everyone learns the rules so prepare for about an hour each game, however, with time this gets closer to the time on the box of 30 minutes.
