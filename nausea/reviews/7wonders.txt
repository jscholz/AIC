review/text: Based on the reviews, it's clear that this is a fun game IF you have someone who knows how to play it who can teach it to you. In our case we had 4 people (2 of them with PhDs) trying to figure out the directions for 45 mins with no luck. Then we resorted to youtube for help, and all of the instructional videos just explained it as "It's simple! Game play is similar to <game I've never heard of> and you collect points just like in <another game of never heard of> and that's all there is to it!" Okay, that's not helpful to me. What a waste of an hour with good friends.

review/text: I bought this game based on the description and reviews which gave the impression that this game is simple, easy to learn, and quick to play. We just spent an hour trying to figure out how to START the game and decided to give up. The directions are terrible. Maybe it would be a fun game if it could be explained better (a lot better).

review/text: This game went very slowly the first time through. Five non-gamers studying the rule-book spent a lot of time saying "I don't get it." Once we all did untangle the rules and intricasies of the game, the second and third games were quick and enjoyable. The more we play, the more we uncover strategies and complexities that will make it worth replaying many times. We got multiple games this Christmas, and this was the most difficult to play the first time, but it turned out to be the favorite, likely to be replayed many times. It was definitely worth muddling that initial first play-through. In retrospect, we should have watched a youtube video of the game first. Even better, if you can play this with at least one person who is already familiar with the game, that will save you a lot of frustration.
